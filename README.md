# Wesapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## Wesley's words 
I did this app using 
node version around "10.15.1" and "npm": "^6.4.1". Another version might work or not. 
npm run start:dev to run the server in dev mode. 
typescript, compiler and compiler-cli are in the dev dependences because heroku needs those. 
I also used the time-ago-pipe library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/time-ago-pipe) to save the "app added x time ago" feature.
Im not an angular2+ expert but I did my best and I hope you enjoy it.
